# 🌍 Travel Landing Page

[🌐 Live Demo](https://yuriidano.github.io/travel/)

**Travel Landing** is a modern, responsive landing page designed to showcase travel services and destinations with an engaging and user-friendly interface.

## 👨‍💻 About This Project

This project was fully implemented by me as a responsive travel landing page designed to promote destinations and travel services.

The design was based on an existing layout, but I built the page from scratch — including all responsive structure, animations, and section composition.

The focus was on flawless implementation, clean and semantic HTML markup, BEM-based CSS, and a user-friendly interface on all screen sizes.

This project demonstrates my ability to convert user interface design into modern, responsive, and ready-to-use landing pages.
